## ToDo
- [ ] Most interactions should involve some sort of input values. Input values may be
specified using menus, radio buttons, checkboxes, scrollers
- [ ] You are required to implement at least 5 kinds of user interactions that lead to executing
a query with a join, a group by, or both. You may decide to implement additional
interactions that select data from 1 table at a time, or that insert, update or modify data.
Still, at least 5 of the queries you implement must involve a join, a group by, or
both
- [ ] You should prepare slides for a 3-minute presentation describing your application, and
record a video with your presentation.
- [ ] Each project partner should prepare a statement of contributions: a document
describing their own and their partner’s contributions to the project. This part of the
assignment is to be completed individually. Do not discuss the content of this
document with your partner, and do not collaborate on this document
